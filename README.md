## Clustering 

### Customer Segmentation and Shopping Analysis

### Objective
The goal of this project was to identify important customer groups based on income, age, and shopping score in order to develop a targeted approach. I employed exploratory data analysis techniques, clustering algorithms, and data visualization to achieve this objective.

### Key Techniques Used
- In-depth exploratory data analysis
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN)
- Data visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots)

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Clustering Algorithm Performance Evaluation

### Objective
In this project, I evaluated the performance of different clustering algorithms on multiple datasets. The goal was to determine the optimal algorithm for specific data characteristics and enhance clustering accuracy. The conclusion drawn from the evaluation was that "DBSCAN" emerged as the better clustering algorithm for distant and sparse clusters.

### Key Techniques Used
- Performance evaluation of clustering algorithms
- Comparison of clustering accuracy
- Identification of optimal algorithm for specific data characteristics

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Highlights or Achievements
- Achieved X% improvement in accuracy with DBSCAN clustering algorithm
- Implemented interactive features in Power BI dashboards, increasing user engagement by Y%
- Presented findings from Customer Segmentation project at industry conference XYZ

## Business Intelligence
  
### HR Data Analysis Dashboard

### Objective
In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze company turnover rates and identify the reasons for employee attrition. The objective was to uncover actionable insights for improving retention strategies and enhancing employee satisfaction.

### Key Techniques Used
- Data visualization techniques in Power BI
- Analysis of turnover rates and employee attrition
- Identification of retention strategies

### Technologies Used
- Power BI
- SQL
- Microsoft Excel

## Interactive Sales Dashboard

### Objective
The objective of this project was to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Power BI sales dashboard for an e-commerce store. The dashboard tracked and analyzed real-time online sales data to provide actionable insights and trends.

### Key Techniques Used
- Real-time data analysis
- Dynamic and interactive dashboard design
- Sales performance tracking and analysis

### Technologies Used
- Power BI
- SQL
- Microsoft Excel
