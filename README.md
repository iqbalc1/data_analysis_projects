# Project Description

Here you will find an overview of some of my projects and the insights derived from each one. 

## Customer Segmentation and Shopping Analysis

### Objective
The goal of this project was to identify important customer groups based on income, age, and shopping score in order to develop a targeted approach. I employed exploratory data analysis techniques, clustering algorithms, and data visualization to achieve this objective.

### Key Techniques Used
- In-depth exploratory data analysis
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN)
- Data visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots)

## Clustering Algorithm Performance Evaluation

### Objective
In this project, I evaluated the performance of different clustering algorithms on multiple datasets. The goal was to determine the optimal algorithm for specific data characteristics and enhance clustering accuracy. The conclusion drawn from the evaluation was that "DBSCAN" emerged as the better clustering algorithm for distant and sparse clusters.

### Key Techniques Used
- Performance evaluation of clustering algorithms
- Comparison of clustering accuracy
- Identification of optimal algorithm for specific data characteristics
